We say a point $(x^*,y^*)$ is a geometric median of $n$ points $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$ on the 2D-plane
if $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{(x^*-x_i)^2+(y^*-y_i)^2}=\min_{x,y}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}$.

It is probably too hard for you to find a geometric median in general. So please try to solve the cases for $n=4$.
