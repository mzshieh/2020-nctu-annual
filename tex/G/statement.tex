The classic computer screens can only display text.
Typically, such a screen has 24 rows and 80 columns.
Vintage Display Technology Company (VDTC) plans to produce some old fashioned 
computer screen. 
But it is no cool to display only 24 rows on one screen.
VDTC wants their screens to have enough rows for some classical literature
under the constraint that each row may only display 80 characters.
To ideally display an article on the screen, the following rules may not be
violated.
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item The words must displayed in the order in the article.
\item Any of the words must be displayed on exactly one row. 
\item Any two consecutive words must be separated by a blank or a newline. 
\end{itemize}

Your task is to help VDTC to compute how many rows are required to display
an article. If you manage to write such a program, then VDTC may use the 
program to analyze articles and determine the ideal number of rows of 
their new products.
