This problem is about to construct a simple directed acyclic graph (DAG) 
of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
The graph must have the vertex set be $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Any edge $(u,v)$ in this graph must satisfy $u < v$.
Any vertex $u$ may have at most $k$ out-going edges.
And multiple edges are not allowed.

You are given three numbers $n,k,a$ where $n$ is the number of vertices and $k$ is the limit of out-going edges.
Please determine whether there is a simple DAG such that there are at least $a^n$ paths from $1$ to $n$.
