The classic computer screens can only display text.
Typically, such a screen has 24 rows and 80 columns.
Vintage Display Technology Company (VDTC) plans to produce yet another
kind of old fashioned computer screen. 
But it is no cool to display only 80 columns on one screen.
VDTC wants their screens to have enough columns for some classical literature
under the constraint that each screen may only display 24 rows.
To ideally display an article on the screen, the following rules may not be
violated.
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item The words must displayed in the order in the article.
\item Any of the words must be displayed on exactly one row. 
\item Any two consecutive words must be separated by a blank or a newline. 
\end{itemize}

Your task is to help VDTC to compute how many columns are required to display
an article. If you manage to write such a program, then VDTC may use the 
program to analyze articles and determine the ideal number of columns of 
their new products.
