There is a secret string $s$ with only English letters in lowercase.
And Eddy wonders how many different strings satisfying the following conditions.
\begin{itemize}
\item The string is of length $x$.
\item The string consists of only English letters in lowercase.
\item The secret string is a substring of the string.
\end{itemize}

Because the number can be very large, please output the number 
modulo $998244353$.
