Adam is a 10-year-old boy.
He knows how to perform arithmetic operations which are addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Today, his older brother Alan gives him an arithmetic challenge.
Alan gives Adam two numbers $p$ and $q$ where $-1000\le p\le q\le 1000$.
Alan wants Adam to 
compute the sum of the integer between $p$ and $q$, inclusively.
In other words, Adam is asked to compute $p+(p+1)+\cdots+q$.
Adam does not want to perform so many arithmetic operations, 
since he wants to play ``Animal Crossing.'' 
Please write a program to help Adam, because you want to play 
``Animal Crossing'' with him.
