There are $n$ bamboo rats and $n$ burrows (holes in the ground dug by animal)
on the flat. We specify their positions with 2D coordinates. 
Bamboo rat $i$ is at $(x_i,y_i)$, and burrow $j$ is at $(p_j,q_j)$. 
A bamboo rat needs to consume $d^2$ grams of bamboo leaves to move $d$ meters.
The bamboo rats have to stay in the burrows to wait out the winter season.
Otherwise, the Chinese will catch them and eat them.
It is too cruel to watch the bamboo rat in the videos uploaded by mukbangers.
So you decide to help these $n$ bamboo rats to move to the burrows.
However, every burrow may only accommodate one bamboo rat.
You have to find a way to assign the burrows to the bamboo rats. 
Moreover, you want to save the bamboo leaves for overwintering.
Please write a program to compute the least amount of bamboo leaves consumed
by the bamboo rats.
