We say a point $(x,y)$ on the 2D-plane is a lattice point if $x$ and $y$ are integers.
We say a non-degenerated triangle is an ideal triangle if all of its vertices are lattice points.
You are given a positive $n$ and asked to generate an ideal triangle such that 
there are exactly $n$ lattice points on its boundary.

Note: the area of a non-generated triangle is positivel.
