The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ separated by blanks.
The $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$
and $t_i$ separated by blanks.
The $i$-th edge connects vertex $u_i$ and $v_i$.
$t_i$ indicates the color of the $i$-th edge. 
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item $t_i=1$: the $i$-th edge is colored in black.
\item $t_i=2$: the $i$-th edge is colored in white.
\item $t_i=3$: the $i$-th edge is colored in gray.
\item $t_i=4$: the $i$-th edge is colored in silver.
\end{itemize}
