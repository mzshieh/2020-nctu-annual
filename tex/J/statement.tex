There is an undirected graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
The vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.
Every edge is colored in one of four colors: black, white, gray, and silver.

Your task is to color vertices with black and white under the 
following constraints.
\begin{itemize}
\item At least one endpoint of a black edge is colored in black.
\item At least one endpoint of a white edge is colored in white.
\item Two endpoints of a gray edge are colored in different color.
\item Two endpoints of a silver edge are colored in the same color.
\end{itemize}

If there is no way to color the vertices without violating the constraints,
outpu \verb+NO+. Otherwise, output the colors of the vertices.
