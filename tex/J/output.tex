If there is no way to color the vertices under all constraints, then output
``\verb+NO+'' without quotes.
Otherwise, output ``\verb+YES+'' without quotes on the first line.
Then, output a string $s$ on the second line.
The string $s$ indicates a way to color the vertices under the constraints.
The vertex $i$ is colored in white if the $i$-th character is \verb+0+.
The vertex $i$ is colored in black if the $i$-th character is \verb+1+.
