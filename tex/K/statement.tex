We say a point $(x,y)$ on the 2D-plane is a lattice point if $x$ and $y$ are integers.
We say a non-degenerated triangle is a ideal triangle if all of its vertices are lattice points.
You are given an ideal triangle $n$. Please compute the number of lattice points on its boundary.

Note: the area of a non-degenerated triangle is positive.
