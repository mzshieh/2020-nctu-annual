Given $n$ lines $L_1,L_2,\ldots,L_n$ where 
$L_i$ is $a_ix+b_iy=c_i$ for $i\in \{1,2,\dots,n\}$.
In this problem, all the coefficients $a_i$'s, $b_i$'s and $c_i$'s are integers.
Two lines intersect if they have some point in common. 
Such points are called intersections of lines.

In general, to compute the number of intersections of lines can be hard.
Tn this problem, you may assume there are no three lines have a common point.
To save time, if there are more than $10^6$ intersections of lines,
please output ``\verb+TOO MANY+''.
Otherwise, please output the number of intersections of lines.
