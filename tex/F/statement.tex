You are given a positive integer $n$. 
You have infinite supplies of $1$'s, additions, multiplications and brackets for composing an expression. 
What is the least total number of additions and multiplications required to compose an expression evaluated into $n$?

For example, $n=9=(1+1+1)\times(1+1+1)$ can be evaluated with $5$ operations 
and it is impossible to use $4$ operations to compose an expression evaluated into $9$.
Therefore, you should output $5$.
Note that concatenating $1$'s is not allowed.
