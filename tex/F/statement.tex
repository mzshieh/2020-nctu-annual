Iðunn is the goddess of apples of youth in Norse mythology. 
It is said that the gods in Norse mytholody must eat apples of youth to 
stop aging. 
Loki once decoyed Iðunn out of Asgard (where the gods live). 
Without Iðunn's 
apples, the gods became old and grey. They demanded Loki to return Iðunn. 
Loki turned her into a nut and took her back to Asgard. 

Iðunn's job is collecting apples of youth in the garden of Asgard. 
There are $n$ apple trees (numbered from $1$ to $n$) and $n-1$ trails 
(numbered from $1$ to $n-1$) in the garden. 
Each trail ends at two different apple trees. 
For any pair of apple trees, Iðunn can move from one to another along 
the trails in the garden.
Suppose that apple 
tree $i$ has $d_i$ trails ending at it. Iðunn collects apples according the 
following procedure everyday.
\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item Iðunn randomly moves to a tree with probability $\frac{d_i}{2n-2}$.
\item Iðunn uniformly randomly picks a trail ending at her current position, 
then she moves to the other end of the trail.
\item Collect apples from the tree at her position. 
If the tree is numbered $i$, then she should collect $a_i$ apples.
\item Repeat the previous two steps for $k$ times.
\end{enumerate}

Write a program to compute the excepted number of apples daily collected by 
Iðunn.
